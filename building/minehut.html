        my time at Minehut, a popular server hosting network, as a moderator, I got the opportunity to make changes to the lobby. (2024's <a href="https://minehut.wiki.gg/wiki/Lobbies#Construction_Lobby"
          class="text-orange-200">Construction Lobby</a>)</p>
      <p><br>My first addition to the lobby was a meeting room, as you can see above, for the staff team to convene in
        during a staff meeting. While building this, I was accompanied by my friends who offered helpful insight -
        though the general design is my own. The version you see above is the final version, but it did undergo some
        changes.</p>

      <p>Above, you can see an earlier version of this meeting room featuring a more simple floor, ceiling and stage.
        You can actually see this room in use as the moderators are in their chairs (well, some of them, atleast!)</p>

      <p>Here's the library I built - a vast improvement over the basic, small, undetailed server room that preceded it.
      </p>
      <p>Above there is also an earlier version of this build showing off the redstone staircase that allows access to
        the second
        level. This staircase is activated by the mouse (blackstone button) on the desk. <br><br>In my opinion, builds
        in which the players can interact with something are extremely effective in lobbies like Minehut's because it
        really makes exploring the lobby interesting. Interactive builds are great for player retention in the lobbies.

      <p>I replaced the old server room with a much better, improved build in the fancy wooden library above.<br><br>The
        server room was not removed entirely though—it was moved into an area accessible through a secret painting.
        It was repurposed into a server and storage room. In the above image, you can see the storage room section of
        the build.</p>
      <p>Then in the image above, you can see the servers behind the glass. This is a great improvement over what was
        previously there. My intention with this room was to feel like it was intentionally somewhere that was behind
        the scenes of everything. <br><br>The previous server room featured signs on each observer that obviously showed
        what the build was, whereas this version does storytelling by environment and doesn't need such measures.</p>

      <p>Before the new server room was built, you can see what was in place of it. These were meant to be the old
        offices
        of Super League Enterprise employees—a reference to the history of Minehut within the lobby. Safe to say, it
        doesn't look good and clearly and obviously needed improvement.<br><br>There were also even older offices
        referencing the original Minehut creators and developers. Though, it didn't
        really make much sense as this was a lobby created during the GamerSafer era of Minehut. The reference was cool,
        but in practice it didn't make sense. Plus—it was not pleasing to the eyes.
        <br><br>You can also see the brand new offices I built in place of it. To be honest, I still have issues with
        the floor and
        deepslate brick elements of this room, but I'm much happier with it than the original build.<br><br>The second
        new image depicts the upper portions of this room. You accessed this room through the previous storage
        and server room, as I thought it made sense that the administrative offices would be in close proximity to the
        servers.

      <p>Of course, to get to this area, you needed to go through this hallway. The small, crowded hallway just wouldn't
        cut it.</p>
      <p>In the new version, you can see the rejuvenated version of it. I thought the use of lecterns as the floor was
        clever, and the hallway now matches the environment of the other rooms way better.</p>

      <p>As my goal was to provide life where there was not in the lobbies, I saw this building's exterior and decided
        to add some interior design just to add more personality to the lobby.</p>
      <p class="w-3/4 mx-auto"><br>I had so much fun adding these builds to the Minehut lobby and would take the
        opportunity again in a heartbeat if it were presented to me, although I think that ship has sailed since I'm no
        longer part of the volunteer moderation team.<br><br>I was not paid to do this, nor did I expect or ask to be. I
        simply loved the community and the experience was surreal. It's an incredible feeling seeing your own build on
        production.</p>
